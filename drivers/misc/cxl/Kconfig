	help
	  Select this option to enable driver support for IBM Coherent
	  Accelerators (CXL).  CXL is otherwise known as Coherent Accelerator
	  Processor Interface (CAPI).  CAPI allows accelerators in FPGAs to be
	  coherently attached to a CPU via an MMU.  This driver enables
	  userspace programs to access these accelerators via /dev/cxl/afuM.N
	  devices.

	  CAPI adapters are found in POWER8 based systems.

	  If unsure, say N.

config CXL_PCI
	tristate "Support for CXL devices via PCI"
	depends on CXL && PPC_POWERNV
	default y
	help
	  Select this option to support CXL devices detected via PCI, e.g.
	  when running under Sapphire. This has no effect on CXL devices
	  detected via the device tree, such as when running under PowerVM.

config CXL_OF
	tristate "Support for CXL devices on PowerVM"
	depends on CXL
	default y
	help
	  Select this option to support CXL devices detected via the device
	  tree, such as when running under PowerVM.
