Slave contexts (eg. /sys/class/cxl/afu0.0):

What:		/sys/class/cxl/<afu>/irqs_max
Date:		September 2014
Contact:	Ian Munsie <imunsie@au1.ibm.com>,
		Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>
Description:	read/write
		Maximum number of interrupts that can be requested by userspace.
		The default on probe is the maximum that hardware can support 
		(eg.2037).  Write values will limit userspace applications to
		that many userspace interrupts.  Must be >= irqs_min.

What:		/sys/class/cxl/<afu>/irqs_min
Date:		September 2014
Contact:	Ian Munsie <imunsie@au1.ibm.com>,
		Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>
Description:	read_only
		The minimum number of interrupts that userspace must request on
		a CXL_START_WORK ioctl.  Userspace may request -1 in the IOCTL
		to get value minimum automatically.

What:		/sys/class/cxl/<afu>/mmio_size
Date:		September 20141
Contact:	Ian Munsie <imunsie@au1.ibm.com>,
		Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>
Description:	read only
		Size of the MMIO space that may be mmaped by userspace.


What:		/sys/class/cxl/<afu>/models_supported
Date:		September 2014
Contact:	Ian Munsie <imunsie@au1.ibm.com>,
		Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>
Description:	read only
		List of the models this AFU supports.
		Valid entries are: "dedicated_process" and "afu_directed"

What:		/sys/class/cxl/<afu>/model
Date:		September 2014
Contact:	Ian Munsie <imunsie@au1.ibm.com>,
		Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>
Description:	read/write
		The current model the AFU is using.  Will be one of the models
		given in models_supported.  Writing will change the model but
		no user contexts can be attached at this point.


What:		/sys/class/cxl/<afu>/prefault_mode
Date:		September 2014
Contact:	Ian Munsie <imunsie@au1.ibm.com>,
		Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>
Description:	read/write
		Set the mode for prefaulting in segments into the segment table
		when performing the START_WORK ioctl.  Possible values:
			none: No prefaulting (default)
			wed: Just prefault in the wed
			all: all segments this process currently maps

What:		/sys/class/cxl/<afu>/reset
Date:		September 2014
Contact:	Ian Munsie <imunsie@au1.ibm.com>,
		Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>
Description:	write only
		Reset the AFU.

Date:		September 2014
Contact:	Ian Munsie <imunsie@au1.ibm.com>,
		Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>
Description:	read only
		Size of the MMIO space that may be mmaped by userspace.  This
		includes all slave contexts space also


What:		/sys/class/cxl/<afu>m/pp_mmio_len
Date:		September 2014
Contact:	Ian Munsie <imunsie@au1.ibm.com>,

Description:	read only
		Per Process MMIO space length.

Date:		September 2014
Contact:	Ian Munsie <imunsie@au1.ibm.com>,
		Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>
Description:	read only
		Per Process MMIO space offset.
